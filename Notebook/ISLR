When working with data, our goal is to comprehend how one variable influences another. For instance, we often associate cloudy skies with rain.  
The presence of clouds serves as an observation or predictor that informs our prediction of rain. Conversely, if there are no clouds, we tend to expect no rain. 
This intuitive connection has developed over time due to our repeated experiences. In essence, we've gathered these observations throughout our lives. 
Consequently, when we encounter cloudy skies, we instinctively anticipate rain, and the absence of clouds suggests dry weather. 
Our extensive lifetime experiences have provided us with enough data to confidently assume that if it's not cloudy, it's unlikely to rain.

In the realm of statistics, these observations, such as cloudy skies, go by various names: they are referred to as inputs, predictors, features, or independent variables. 
On the other hand, the resulting outcome, such as whether it will rain, can be known as the response, dependent, or target variable.
With the aid of data, our objective is to either forecast future events or gain insights into how these observations influence the outcome
