> Notes from Medium.com, How to derive B0 and B1 in Linear Regression- Part2.

B0 represents the intercept, and B1 represents the slope in regression analysis. The relationship between Y and X is described by the equation Y = B0 + B1*X. 
When examining variables that exhibit a linear trend, the regression curve takes the form Yi = B0 + B1Xi + Sigmai.

Sigmai is commonly referred to as the Gaussian error term, and it is independent and normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of sigma^2. 
Since the Gaussian error term is independent and follows a normal distribution, this implies that the response variable Y is also an independent random variable.

In linear regression, our goal is to identify the best-fitting line, expressed as Y = B0 + B1*X. The parameters B0 and B1 are determined in such a way that the line represents the trend with the least amount of error. 
Thus, the primary objective in linear regression is to find the values of B0 and B1 that minimize the error introduced when fitting the regression line."
